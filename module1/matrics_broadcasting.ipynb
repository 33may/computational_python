    "### **Introduction**\n",
    "\n",
    "Matrix operations are foundational to computational programming, especially in fields like data analysis, scientific computing, and machine learning. Efficient manipulation of matrices can significantly improve the performance of numerical algorithms. NumPy's broadcasting feature allows us to perform operations across rows, columns, or higher-dimensional arrays without explicitly looping through elements, resulting in more concise and faster code.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment, we will explore how to use **broadcasting** in NumPy to efficiently normalize the rows and columns of a matrix. Normalization is a common preprocessing step that scales data to a consistent range, making it easier to analyze or process further. Specifically, we will compare two approaches:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **For-Loop Implementation**:\n",
    "   - A traditional approach that explicitly iterates through rows or columns.\n",
    "   - While intuitive, this method is computationally expensive, especially for large matrices.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Broadcasting Implementation**:\n",
    "   - A vectorized approach that leverages NumPy's ability to apply operations over axes without explicit loops.\n",
    "   - This method is more efficient and compact, demonstrating the power of broadcasting.\n",
    "\n",

    "### **Objectives**\n",
    "By the end of this assignment, you will:\n",
    "1. Understand how **broadcasting** works in NumPy and how it can replace explicit loops in numerical computations.\n",
    "2. Implement two methods (for-loop and broadcasting) to normalize the rows and columns of a matrix.\n",
    "3. Compare the performance of the two methods using timing utilities like `timeit` or `perf_counter`.\n",
    "4. Document your findings in a clear and structured manner, showcasing the advantages of broadcasting.\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **What You Will Do**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Matrix Normalization**:\n",
    "   - Write a function to normalize the rows of a matrix:\n",
    "     - Divide each element of a row by the sum of all elements in that row.\n",
    "   - Write a similar function to normalize the columns of a matrix:\n",
    "     - Divide each element of a column by the sum of all elements in that column.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **For-Loop Implementation**:\n",
    "   - Use nested loops to iterate through rows or columns and normalize them.\n",
    "   - Measure the time taken for this approach on a large matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Broadcasting Implementation**:\n",
    "   - Use NumPy's broadcasting to achieve the same results without explicit loops.\n",
    "   - Measure the time taken for this approach and compare it to the loop-based implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Performance Comparison**:\n",
    "   - Use a large randomly generated matrix to benchmark both implementations.\n",
    "   - Visualize the results (e.g., using bar charts) to highlight the difference in performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Deliverable**:\n",
    "   - A well-documented Jupyter Notebook with:\n",
    "     - Clear explanations of each step.\n",
    "     - Code for both methods.\n",
    "     - Timing results and performance comparison.\n",
    "     - Insights and takeaways from the experiment.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Expected Outcomes**\n",
    "- A deeper understanding of how broadcasting simplifies and speeds up matrix operations.\n",
    "- A practical demonstration of the performance benefits of vectorized operations over traditional loops.\n",
    "- A portfolio-worthy notebook showcasing efficient matrix manipulation, a skill highly valued in computational programming.\n",
